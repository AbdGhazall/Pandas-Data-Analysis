# Data analysis using Pandas

>This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks focused on learning and practicing pandas for data analysis. The notebooks are designed to help you grasp both the basics and advanced functionalities of pandas using various datasets.

## Notebooks

### 1. **Pandas Basics**

This notebook covers essential pandas topics such as:

-   **DataFrames**: Selection and Indexing, Creating a new column, Removing Columns, Selecting Rows, Conditional Selection, Index Details
-   **Missing Data**: Handling missing data using `isnull`, `dropna`, `fillna`, `ffill`, `interpolate`
-   **Groupby**: Grouping data with simple examples
-   Merging, Joining, and Concatenating: Demonstrating the difference between these operations with new DataFrames
-   **Operations**: Working with DataFrames (e.g., unique values, sorting, applying functions, checking for nulls)
-   **Data Input and Output**: Loading and saving data from/to CSV and Excel files
-   **Additional Important Topics**: Covering Pivot Tables, Handling Duplicates, Reshaping with `melt()`, and DateTime Handling

### 2. **Pandas Advanced Examples**

This notebook delves into more complex pandas operations, including:

-   **Intro to DataFrames**: Understanding DataFrame structure
-   **Loading DataFrames from Files**: Importing data from various file types
-   **Accessing Data**: Retrieving data using pandas methods
-   **Filtering Data**: Techniques for filtering datasets
-   **Adding/Removing Columns**: Modifying DataFrame structure
-   **Merging & Concatenating Data**: Combining datasets effectively
-   **Handling Null Values**: Strategies for dealing with missing data
-   **Aggregating Data**: Summarizing data with pandas
-   **Advanced Functionality**: Exploring additional pandas features

## Data Files

To start working with the notebooks, you'll need to upload the following data files to your Google Colab environment:

1.  **bios.csv**: Contains biographical data.
2.  **bios_new.csv**: Updated version of the biographical data.
3.  **coffe.csv**: Data related to coffee.
4.  **noc_regions.csv**: Contains data on country codes and regions.
5.  **olympics-data.xlsx**: Data related to the Olympics, including results and statistics.
6.  **results.parquet**: Contains results in Parquet format, a columnar storage file format.

## How to Use

1.  Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2.  Upload the data files listed above to your Colab environment.
3.  Upload the notebooks to your Colab environment.
4.  Run each cell in the notebooks to execute the code and see the output.
